Weekend Roundup: Pope Francis Resurrects Liberation Theology -- Without Marx,"If communism is ""The God That Failed,"" liberation theology is the gospel that has succeeded. Marx may be dead, but the cause of the poor and oppressed has been resurrected.

This is the message the Argentine pope, Francis, sent by canonizing Oscar Romero, reversing decades of conservative opposition in the church hierarchy and setting the El Salvadoran archbishop on the road to sainthood. Romero was gunned down at the altar in 1980 by a right-wing death squad that regarded him as a dangerous Marxist because of his activism on behalf of the poor.

As Paul Vallely writes, Romero is an exemplar for Francis. Both are ""orthodox and yet utterly radical."" Romero is ""a priest whose life stands in testament to the kind of Catholicism preferred by a pope who declared within days of his election that he wanted 'a poor Church for the poor.'"" <em>(continued)</em>",Nathan Gardels,05/29/15,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/weekend-roundup-68_b_7471318

Weekend Roundup: Turkey's 'Two Souls' Are Being Torn Apart,"The characters in Orhan Pamuk's novels are complex, hybrid identities. They are neither purely Islamic traditionalists nor secular fundamentalists, but, as Turkey's most celebrated writer and Nobel laureate has put it, of ""two souls."" ""To have two souls,"" Pamuk once told me, ""is a good thing. That is the way people really are. We have to understand that, just like a person, a country can have two souls.""

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's military-allied, authoritarian and Western-oriented modernization from above bolstered one aspect of that soul in the last century. Over the last 13 years, current Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Islamic-based AKP has bolstered the other aspect through democratic modernization from below. In the process, political space has opened up not only to the influence of conservative rural Anatolia but also for other plural constituencies from Kurds to the gay community.

By trying to close that plural space now through increasingly autocratic tendencies -- in the midst of the Syrian civil war spilling over its borders -- Erdoğan has polarized the ""two souls"" of Turkey. For Pamuk, ""to have democracy is precisely to have a dialogue between these two souls."" ""I am worried,"" he says, ""because I know that in the end Erdoğan wants to govern alone at all costs. He does not want to share power."" <em>(continued)</em>",Nathan Gardels,10/16/15,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/weekend-roundup-88_b_8316120
